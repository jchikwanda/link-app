# Link App

Link App is a mobile application built using Expo that allows users to preview links using a web view. It provides a simple interface with buttons to navigate between different links and view their contents.

## Features

- Preview Links: Users can select from a predefined list of links and preview their contents in a web view.
- Navigation Buttons: Users can easily navigate between different links using previous and next buttons.
- WebView Interaction: The web view allows users to interact with the linked content, such as scrolling, zooming, and tapping on links.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/link-app.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd link-app`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

### Usage

1. Ensure you have Expo CLI installed globally: `npm install --global expo-cli`
2. Run the application using Expo: `expo start`


3. The Expo development server will start, and you will be provided with options to run the app on an iOS simulator, Android emulator, or physical devices.

4. On the home screen, you will see a list of predefined links.

5. Tap on a link to preview its contents in the web view.

6. Use the previous and next buttons to navigate between different links.

7. Interact with the web view by scrolling, zooming, or tapping on links.

### Trying it Out

- If you just want to try out the app without setting up a development environment, you can download the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device. Then, scan the QR code generated by `expo start` using the Expo Go app to load and run the app on your device.

## Limitations

- Customization: Due to the limitations of the app, users cannot provide their own links or customize the predefined links. The app is designed for demonstration purposes and showcases how to use a web view to preview links.
